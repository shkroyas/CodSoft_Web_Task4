			<h2>Here's a brief description of Mahabir Pun's life:</h2>
			<p>After working as a teacher for several years, he completed a master's degree in education at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Mahabir has constructed computer labs at several schools in the area and planned out the entire Nepal Wireless network. He plans to to continue to expand access in the future.</p><p>

				What started as a venture only for his locality has now become the nation-wide project. People are hugely benefitted with his projects. Now, his project is directed towards connecting all the remote areas of country. I read in one interview that people are greatly affected with the boon he brought. Villagers can now make telephone calls, tele-medicine is working fine and exchange of ideas and informations all possible. Some dying people got new life because of tele-medicine where doctor prescribes medicine from other end.</p><p>
				
				He is very down-to-earth person and very ordinary looking guy who induced big donors like Bill gates to donate for the development of remote villages, Information Technology and living standard of poor Nepalese who are forced to live under poverty line. I'm really touched because of the way he conveys his messages and to know his virtues intentions. He is very deliberate person that I came know when he made computers for the schools he opened in his villages. He made computers to operate by assembling parts from the debris of computer wastes. He made wooden casings for those motherboards and other circuitries to remain in single box. He thought that some other's waste is big assets for poor Nepalese people. So many westerners are amazed by his efforts and admiring for his noble cause. He taught basic computers and other education for his poor people for free.</p><p>
				
				Therefore, we all Nepalese felt very honored when Mahabir Pun was awarded with The 2007 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership. He really deserves this honor. But, he thinks it's too early for him to get this award (though he doesn't expect for any award or his efforts were not award-motivated) since he still has so many achievements to get. Whatever, I personally like to thank him and pray to god and wish him (from all of us, proud Nepalese) best of luck in all his endeavors.</p>
